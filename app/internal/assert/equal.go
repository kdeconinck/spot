// Package assert provides small helper functions for writing tests.
//
// The helpers in this package are intentionally minimal and work with Go's standard [testing] package without
// introducing external dependencies.
//
// Instead of accepting [testing.TB], the helpers use a small interface ([TB]).
// The [testing.TB] interface includes an unexported method, which prevents custom implementations outside the standard
// library.
// By accepting a minimal interface, the helpers remain compatible with [testing.T] and [testing.B] while still allowing
// strict test doubles.
package assert

import _ "testing"

// Equal reports a test failure using [TB.Fatalf] if got and want are not equal.
//
// The comparison uses the == operator, so V must satisfy the [comparable] constraint.
//
// The failure message includes testName.
// If label is not empty, it is appended to the "Expected" and "Actual" field names.

// Equalf reports a test failure using [TB.Fatalf] if got and want are not equal.
//
// The comparison uses the == operator, so V must satisfy the [comparable] constraint.
